# LinkedIn Web Scraper

## This is a simple web scraper for LinkedIn, written in Python. 

It goes through all contacts and returns the name, the job, the company, the location, the email, and the phone number of every contact, and also writes it in an Excel file.

### REQUIRES YOU DOWNLOAD CHROME DRIVER TO RUN. 
(Make sure the ChromeDriver version you install matches your Chrome Browser version)
(You can check this by going in  **â‹®** > Help > About Chrome 

**Make sure you have the right libraries pip installed.**

**Make sure you edit "linkedinparameters.py" to match your own login info and path of Chrome Driver.**

Two files, like a 100 lines of code only. Pretty straight forward.
